This a utility to convert a PCB123 netlist
to a kicad netlist.

No guarantees at all... You use pcb2kicad at your own risk.

This directory contains:
  makefile  
  netL.l  
  netY.y  
  test.net
  out.net  

To Build on a Linux box:
  make

To run a test:
  pcb2kicad < pcb123.net >out.net

out.net can be edited to add actual part types or schematic symbol 
references.  KiCad netlist editor can also be used to select actual 
footprints.

Note: Beware KiCad currently limits PinNames to 4 characters.
These name should probably be truncated to make KiCad happy.
EDIF import uses the Rename directive if present.
