/*
 *  An aperture macro defines a complex shape and is a list of aperture primitives.
 *  Each aperture primitive defines a simple shape (circle, rect, regular polygon...)
 *  Inside a given aperture primitive, a fixed list of parameters defines info
 *  about the shape: size, thickness, number of vertex ...
 *
 *  Each parameter can be an immediate value or a defered value.
 *  When value is defered, it is defined when the aperture macro is instancied by
 *  an ADD macro command
 *  Note also a defered parameter can be defined in aperture macro,
 *  but outside aperture primitives. Example
 *  %AMRECTHERM*
 *  $4=$3/2*    parameter $4 is half value of parameter $3
 *  21,1,$1-$3,$2-$3,0-$1/2-$4,0-$2/2-$4,0*
 *  For the aperture primitive, parameters $1 to $3 will be defined in ADD command,
 *  and $4 is defined inside the macro
 *
 *  Each basic shape can be a positive shape or a negative shape.
 *  a negative shape is "local" to the whole shape.
 *  It must be seen like a hole in the shape, and not like a standard negative object.
