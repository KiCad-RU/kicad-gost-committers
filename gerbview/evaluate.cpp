/* How to evaluate an arithmetic expression like those used in Aperture Macro Definition in Gerber?
 *
 *  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28256/equation-expression-parser-with-precedence
 *
 *  The shunting yard algorithm is the right tool for this.
 *  Wikipedia is really confusing about this, but basically the algorithm works like this:
 *
 *  Say, you want to evaluate 1 + 2 * 3 + 4. Intuitively, you "know" you have to do the 2 * 3 first,
 *  but how do you get this result?
 *  The key is to realize that when you're scanning the string from left to right, you will evaluate
 *  an operator when the operator that follows it has a lower (or equal to) precedence.
 *
 *  In the context of the example, here's what you want to do:
 *
 *   Look at: 1 + 2, don't do anything.
 *   Now look at 1 + 2 * 3, still don't do anything.
 *   Now look at 1 + 2 * 3 + 4, now you know that 2 * 3 has to to be evaluated because
 *  the next operator has lower precedence.
 *
 *  How do you implement this?
 *
 *  You want to have two stacks, one for numbers, and another for operators.
 *  You push numbers onto the stack all the time.
 *  You compare each new operator with the one at the top of the stack,
 *  if the one on top of the stack has higher priority, you pop it off the operator stack,
 *  pop the operands off the number stack, apply the operator and push the result onto the number stack.
 *
 *  Now you repeat the comparison with the top of stack operator.
 *
 *  Coming back to the example, it works like this:
 *
 *  N = [ ] Ops = [ ]
 *
 *   Read 1. N = [1], Ops = [ ]
 *   Read +. N = [1], Ops = [+]
 *   Read 2. N = [1 2], Ops = [+]
 *   Read *. N = [1 2], Ops = [+ *]
 *   Read 3. N = [1 2 3], Ops = [+ *]
 *   Read +. N = [1 2 3], Ops = [+ *]
 *      Pop 3, 2 and execute 2*3, and push result onto N. N = [1 6], Ops = [+]
 *      is left associative, so you want to pop 1, 6 off as well and execute the +. N = [7], Ops = [].
 *       Finally push the [+] onto the operator stack. N = [7], Ops = [+].
 *   Read 4. N = [7 4]. Ops = [+].
 *
 *  You're run out off input, so you want to empty the stacks now.
 *  Upon which you will get the result 11.
