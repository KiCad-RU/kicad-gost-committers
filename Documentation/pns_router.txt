So, finally we've got an integrated interactive, push-and-sometimes-shove router, although with a very limited user interface:

- Edit->Interactive router launches the tool,
- while routing: 'V' key places a via,
- '+' and '-' keys cycle through available layers,
- '/' key switches track posture.

Via/track dimensions are taken from the netclasses. 
There are no other options available for the time being - promise to add them soon :)
