--== notes about wxWidgets problems ==--

Kicad needs wxWidgets, the multi platform G.U.I toolkit.

use *only* wxWidgets >= 3.0.2

Known bug on Windows:
Postscript printers print tracks like thin line.
It happens only for PS drivers, and PDF printer.
Other drivers (PCL for instance) work fine,
so it is unlikely a bug inside Kicad/wxWidgets

Window version :
The mirror mode gives a blank sheet.
This is a bug in wxWidgets 3.0.2
wxWidgets 3.0.2 must be patched (see patches/wxWidgets-3.0.2-msw-dc-orientation-fix.patch) and rebuilt.
