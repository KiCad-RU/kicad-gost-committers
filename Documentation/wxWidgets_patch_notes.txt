--== notes about wxWidgets problems ==--
Last Revised: 28-Feb-2010


Kicad needs wxWidgets, the multi platform G.U.I.
Known problems:
wxMSW:
use *only* wxWidgets >= 3.0

wxGTK
Use wxWidgets 2.8.10 or later

Linux and macOSX
- Printing problems (all version).
Note old versions of wxWidgets give *very ugly results*
(poor printing resolution set to 72ppi)

So use a very recent version (>= 2.8.10 (that also solve other bugs)

wxWidgets patch:


wxWidgets 2.9.1 (all platforms)
Has a problem when using the built in string to double conversion:
In countries using a comm instead of a point as floating number separator
after calling this conversion function, the comma is changed in point.
(Happens after reading a parameter stored in a wxConfig structure, if this
parameter is a double)
Workaround:
Use a version >= 2.9.3


*************************************************************************************
wxGTK version: All before wxWidgets 3.0
*************************************************************************************
Patch for printing wide traces that were shown with missing rounded end caps.
Without this patch, printing boards and schematics under Linux, and perhaps OSX
gives ugly drawings.

wxGTK-2.8.11/src/generic/dcpsg.cpp
search for:
line 1636
    PsPrint( "%%EndProlog\n" );

Add after this line:
    PsPrint("%%BeginSetup\n");
    PsPrint( "1 setlinecap\n" );
    PsPrint("%%EndSetup\n");


Known bug on Windows:
Postscript printers print tracks like tin line.
It happens only for PS drivers, and PDF printer.
Other drivers (PCL for instance) work fine,
so it is unlikely a bug inside Kicad/wxWidgets
