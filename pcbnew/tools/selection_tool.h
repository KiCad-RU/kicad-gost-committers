 * Our sample selection tool: currently supports:
 * - pick single objects (click LMB)
 * - add objects to existing selection (Shift+LMB)
 * - draw selection box (drag LMB)
 * - handles MODULEs properly (i.e. selects either MODULE or its PADs, TEXTs, etc.)
 * - takes into account high-contrast & layer visibility settings
 * - invokes InteractiveEdit tool when user starts to drag selected items
